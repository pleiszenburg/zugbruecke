How to bisect issues
--------------------

*zugbruecke* is based on a :ref:`session model <session>`. Each session can be launched with parameters, which can either be passed into or picked up by the session constructor from a configuration file. It is also possible to change parameters during run-time.

If you want to increase the log level and/or enable writing of logs to disk during run-time, you can do the following:

.. code:: python

    import zugbruecke.ctypes as ctypes
    from logging import DEBUG
    ctypes.zb_set_parameter('log_level', DEBUG)
    ctypes.zb_set_parameter('log_write', True)
    # proceed as usual - with a lot more verbosity

A custom session can be manipulated in a similar way:

.. code:: python

    from zugbruecke import CtypesSession
    from logging import DEBUG
    ctypes = CtypesSession(log_level = DEBUG, log_write = True)
    # proceed as usual - with a lot more verbosity

Alternatively, you can drop a configuration file named ``.zugbruecke.json`` e.g. into your current working directory or your user account folder, ``/home/username``, and add configuration parameters to it, for example:

.. code:: json

    {"log_level": 10, "log_write": true}

.. note::

    The lower the log level, the more output you will get. *zugbruecke* used Python's ``logging`` module's log levels, see `logging documentation`_: ``DEBUG == 10``, ``INFO == 20``, ``WARNING == 30``, ``ERROR == 40`` and ``CRITICAL == 50``. Default is ``0`` for no logs as per ``NOTSET``.

The on-screen log is color-coded for readability. The log can also, in addition, be written to disk, where every log item with plenty of meta data is represented as a one-line JSON object for easy parsing and analysis of larger log files. For more configuration options check the :ref:`chapter on configuration <configuration>`.

.. _logging documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#logging-levels

As a last resort, you can activate additional debugging features intended for developers by setting the ``ZUGBRUECKE_DEBUG`` environment variable to ``1`` before importing ``zugbruecke`` or any component of it. For this to work, the `typeguard package`_ must be present on your system.

.. _typeguard package: https://typeguard.readthedocs.io/

As an alternative approach, you can also check what happens if you run your code directly in a *Windows Python* interpreter with *ctypes*. Consult the :ref:`chapter on the Wine Python environment <wineenv>` for details. It is easy to get *ctypes* syntax wrong, so this is a good approach for getting it right.

If in doubt, please also test your code with *ctypes* on an actual *Windows* system - it might be a bug in this module or *Wine* as well.

Known issues: Failing to import modules
---------------------------------------

You may encounter issues where *zugbruecke* shows exceptions during initialization, complaining that it could not import ``wenv``, submodules from ``wenv`` or even itself. *zugbruecke* relies on symbolic links to make itself available to a Windows Python interpreter within its dedicated ``site-packages`` folder. This approach has the benefit that if *zugbruecke* and/or its dependency *wenv* are beging updated on the Unix side, the update becomes immediately available to the Wine Python environment with no further user interaction required. Unfortunately, Wine keeps having various issues with handling symbolic links, for instance from stable versions 4.0 to 4.16 and more recently from staging version 7.18 onwards, see `issue 94`_. Those issues break the import mechanisms of Windows builds of CPython. The workaround is to tell *zugbruecke* to copy the required modules into the Wine Python environment via the ``copy_modules`` configuration parameter instead of using symbolic links, see :ref:`section on configuration parameters <configparameter>`. Be aware that this may cause issues when updating *zugbruecke* and/or *wenv* later on. It is recommended to re-create the Wine Python environments in question whenever any of the two packages are updated.

.. _centos:

Known issues: Running on CentOS
-------------------------------

.. warning::

    CentOS packages both CPython and Wine in rather unusual ways, effectively making it a minefield for *zugbruecke*. Avoid CentOS if possible.

*zugbruecke* expects the command for Wine 32 bit to be ``wine`` and the command for Wine 64 bit to be ``wine64``. This is not the case for CentOS' Wine packages where ``wine`` points to Wine 64 bit. However, alternative packages for CentOS restore the expected behaviour. For a discussion see `issue 70`_.

.. _issue 70: https://github.com/pleiszenburg/zugbruecke/issues/70

CentOS uses a customized CPython interpreter which behaves differently compared to a regular CPython interpreter. Notably, in regular builds of CPython, the authentication mechanism used by ``multiprocessing`` for connecting to other processes uses the MD5 hash algorithm by default, which is generally considered insecure. In CentOS, this mechanism was patched to use SHA256 for improved security. As a consequence, CentOS' CPython can not connect to an official Windows build of CPython, causing *zugbruecke* to fail to launch. A discussion and workarounds can be found in `issue 73`_.

.. _issue 73: https://github.com/pleiszenburg/zugbruecke/issues/73

*zugbruecke* is prone to random crashes during startup on older versions of CentOS. An ongoing discussion and a partial workaround can be found in `issue 78`_.
